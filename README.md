The firmware can decode the follow protocols in stand-alone mode (NO PC):
<PRE>
Available SuperH+ built-in/stand-alone demod/decoders
------------------
FM Analog narrow/med/wide (mode fm)
AM Analog narrow/med/wide (mode am)
IQ 16-bit over UDP (mode iq) + GNURadio Driver
P25P1 Voice + Trunking Control Channel (mode p25)
DMR Voice + ConnectPlus Trunking Control Channel (mode dmr)
ADSB Mode-S - Console output (mode adsb)   This mode uses 2 separate ADCs in single ended mode with 2 Msps / 8-bit.
ACARS - Console output (mode acars)
FLEX-4FSK-1600 - Console output (mode pagers, fm)
POCSAG 1200 - Console output (mode pagers, fm)

This is not a cheap build by any measure, but the RF performance is excellent from 10 MHz to 1100 MHz.  Usable tuning range is from around 4 MHz to 1200 MHz.
<BR><BR>
1st IF is 1.5 GHz  (high IF like a typical spectrum analyzer)
<BR><BR>
Baseband filters are 10 - 150 kHz in 16 steps.  70dB adjacent rejection,  100+ dB alternate rejection.
<BR><BR>NCO based final tuning.
<BR><BR>20dB pre-LNA step-attenuator front-end (controlled by AGC)
<BR><BR>AGC + DSP extends dynamic range to over 150dB.
<BR><BR>ACARS receives long messages >350 miles away with an indoor antenna and 0 bit errors.
<BR><BR>DC coupling and extremely stable TCXO makes sub-Hz demodulation with software-based DC offset correction possible
<BR><BR>I/Q ADCs SNR is >= 82 dB in 16-bit differential mode of operation (10-150 kHz baseband filter mode).
